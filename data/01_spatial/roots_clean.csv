Observations of fifty root systems in thirteen locations in Saskatchewan during the present study corroborate the dense, widely spreading nature of the root system. Of particular significance in relation to its drought resistance is the occurrence of numerous, horizontally positioned roots which grow radially in all directions from the bases of stems. This characteristc is most prominent in arid sites, where these roots grow within 3 cm of the soil surface for distances as great as 40 cm. In less xeric situations the surface roots develop at a deeper level or follow an oblique course. The deeply penetrating roots usually descend obliquely or vertically from their origin. Adjustment of the root system to variations in microenvironment imposed by slopes within the dark brown soil zone corresponded to the above adjustments to climate in all respects except depth. While the plants growing in arid positions high on the knoll were more widely spreading, were more densely branched and had more roots per shoot, as compare to those plants on lower slopes, the root depth was only half as great as in the more mesic position.

The central axis of the plant develops a tap root system while adventitious roots are produced from the horizontal stems. The relative extent of development of the thick, deeplyp enetrating tap root and its largest branches, as compared to the mass of fibrous roots developing in the surface layers of soil, is determined apparently by habitat characteristics. In locations where moisture is often deficient near the surface of the soil, but where occasional moisture penetration to considerable depth permits establishment of deep roots, the tap root system is well developed. However, tap roots are not found where deep penetration of moisture is prevented by excessive run-off or where moisture supply in the upper layers of soil is more dependable. Tap roots were found to extend to depths as great as 1.6 m. The depth of rooting ranged from 45 to 165cm. Within the most arid areas (browns oil zone) the roots were regularly deeper than elsewhere (Table 5, Fig. 5). Within all zones, however, the more shallowly rooted plants were associated with dry, shallow eroded soils. These observations suggest sufficient plasticity of the root system to adjust to a semi-arid climate by developing tap roots in periods when moisture penetration permits, but to make use of moisture near the surface in habitats where deeper supplies are continually limiting because of run-off.",Reporting contradicting results: roots in arid sites are deeper AND shallowers than more mesic sites. What's going on? Also mentioned that occasional deep penetration of rain water can lead to deep roots. Also mentioned the plasticity of the roots.,1.47

When dealing with deeply rooting trees, rhizosphere microorganisms, including Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium species, may occur in the deep soil. In fact, Virginia et al. (14) studied the distribution of rhizobia under Prosopis glandulosa in the California Sonoran Desert and reported that population densities as high as
6.1 x 103 cells per g of soil occurred at 4 to 6 m below the ground near the water table. Our results clearly demonstrated that large Bradyrhizobium populations were found in soils at the water table level... We recently found in Kabrousse that population densities of bradyrhizobia were negligible (<l/g of soil) in the soils outside the tree canopy (3a). This suggests that the presence of significant populations of bradyrhizobia depends on root activity and root products.",Fine roots abundance seems to correlate with rhizobium abundance. The two clusters of high rhizobia populations near the surface and right above the WT may be related to the dimorphic root systems observed in deep rooted trees in seasonal climate,34

Chaparral species and their root systems can be placed into three categories: (a) woody, usu- ally sprouting shrubs with deep-penetrating and wide-spreading systems; (b) woody, usually non- sprouting shrubs with shallow but wide-spreading systems; and (c) subshrubs with shallow, fibrous systems. 2. Roots of some species grew through frac- tures in the rock or through weathered rock to a depth of at least 28 feet. Subterranean rock crevices were often filled with a mat of living roots. 3. The depth of soil and the extent to which the underlying rock is weathered and fractured modified the characteristics of the root systems. 4. The roots spread wider than the branches in all species studied. 5. Roots of many species grew uip hill, parallel to the soil surface. 6. Root grafting was not common. It was found only in one species in this study, California scrub oak. 7. Nodules were found on the roots of all spe- cies of Ceanothus.",2.45

These rootlets were brought up on the heavy weight on the end of the cable and must have come from a depth exceeding 68 metres as the borehole was cased with unperforated casing from surface to this depth. The borehole is uncased beyond this depth and it is  possible that the roots were utilising the easy passage made by the borehole to obtain water from the water table at 141 m below the surface. The only fair sized tree in the vicinity of the borehole was a ""motlopi"" (boscia albitrunca) and this was almost certainly the phreatophyte responsible for sending it's roots to this incredible depth.

The downward transition of soil into weathered rock often has an indistinct boundary and tree roots often penetrate deeply into weathered, fractured, or faulted rock. 
The top layer shows little difference, because some early September rainfall wetted the top part of the soil profile. The common pattern nowshows a three-layer profile: a top layer with a high lateral variability, a second layer with water abstraction by trees during the summer, and a base with no change at all. The depth of each zone is very different for the geological substrates in the study area (Fig. 8). In the flysch and basalt, the vegetation uses water from the soil down to 4 m, with maximum extraction around 2 mdeep. On the calcareous sandstone,water is used from below 6 m, the maximum depth of our measurements. On the dolomite,water is used down to 5 m. The resistivity change profiles are also related to the vegetation at the measurement locations. The flysch and basalt areas are coveredwith lowshrub-type forest,whereas on the
calcareous sandstones and dolomite the trees are generally larger, as is
the water abstraction zone.","not direct measurement; max rooting depth taken as max depth of soil water depletion June-Sept with no rain, based on resistivity change; measuremnt stopped at 6m but it is evident that roots go far deeper",7

Most species in the Pantanal are typical of savanna vegetation occurring in Brazil’s central-western plateau, such as..., which were described by Rawitscher (1948) as having deep roots (3 to 8 m). In these same species, we observed shorter roots (<1.4 m) in two savanna physiognomies in the Pantanal wetland. This characteristic had already been observed by Dubs (1992) in savanna forest of the Pantanal in eight savanna tree species displaying root depths no greater than 1.2 m. This ‘‘shortness’’ of roots found in savanna physiognomies of the Pantanal can be explained by the fact that the water table is closer to ground level. According to Gradella et al. (2009), the water table can reach 1.5 m below the soil surface in areas of semideciduous forest in the Pantanal, which probably limits the growth of plant roots... The physiognomies of savanna woodland and open woody savanna occur slightly below the topographic level of the forested areas; hence, these landscapes can be more influenced by the water table. We believe that the water table in the Pantanal plays an important role in determining plant root depth. Savanna species cannot tolerate hypoxia in roots (Joly and Crawford, 1982); hence, woody plants in the Pantanal have a relatively narrower soil layer where roots can grow freely. The maximum depth of the root system is thus limited by the maximum level the water table reaches in the rainy season, when the groundwater is recharged... Some savanna species such as Stryphnodendron adstringens can occur across a wide gradient of savanna physiognomies, adapting to different water table depths. This species also occurs in open woody savanna in the Pantanal. From the data shown in this article, the same wide plasticity may also be occurring in Curatella americana, Tabebuia aurea and Mouriri elliptica.",mean of 10 samples,NA
